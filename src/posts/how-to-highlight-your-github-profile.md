Our github profile is our presentation letter as developers, we can show our projects, skill set, github stats and more. In this post i will show you how to highlight your github profile in two simple steps, let's go.


### 1. Create a markdown

Create a repository as name as your github username, this repository will be special because github will show this file content in your profile, so you only have to customize and be creative. Here are some tips that will help you at the moment that create your markdown:

- Write about your programing languages, tools that you know and use icons for each one 
- Show your github stats, you can use this [api](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) for that, also you can customize the color, border, theme, etc.  Here is an url example:

```markdown
[![Jairo Lachira's GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=your-github-username&show_icons=true&hide_border=false&theme=vue)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
```
> **NOTE**: Don't forget to replace the `your-github-username` parameter with a real value.

- Another interesting api for showing your profile views counter is ðŸ‘‰ [this](https://github.com/antonkomarev/github-profile-views-counter/) , you need to add counter in README.md file in your profile repository by Markdown syntax:
